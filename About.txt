Beginnings is based on Davidii's classic game, Survival 303.
We have been friends with Davidii for many years, and he has encouraged
us as we attempt to expand on his "Survival Series" that we have come to know and love.
Back in its heyday, we were 303's biggest fans. This game is a result of that fandom; it's
and effort to make something great even greater.

Beginnings is made by Sojouner StudiosTM, a collaboration of Shagabash,
FlaminBlade,
And other developers.
